Dear neighbours,

We have been making good progress on the construction of the foundations for the future public park spanning above the rail corridor. We expect that more than one third of the foundation work in the rail corridor will be completed before the holidays. You will be happy to know that we will not carry out any overnight work, including drilling and excavation, from December 23rd  to January 2nd. 

During the holiday period, there will remain some construction activity on our 81 Bay street property as per the schedule below:

 

Day		Hours	

Saturday December 23		9am-7pm	

Sunday December 24		No construction work

We will communicate with you on the first week of January to give you an update on the construction schedule.
