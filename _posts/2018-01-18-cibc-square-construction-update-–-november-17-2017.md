Dear neighbours, 

On October 24th, the Southcore Community Association hosted a public meeting on the project, which allowed us the opportunity to present the project and to hear feedback from the community.  As part of that meeting, we committed to providing updates on our progress. 

Since this meeting, EllisDon, our General Contractor, has completed the installation of a structure along Bay Street that will serve as a temporary material drop-off in order to keep construction activity out of Bay Street, so as not to impede local traffic.  

EllisDon continues the installation of the retention system tie-backs on the south, west and north sides of the excavation and the removal of soil and rock material.  This excavation must be completed by mid-January of next year.  To complete this work on schedule, we anticipate the need to work extended hours from December 1st to January 19th. Upon approval from the City, we expect to work until 10 pm Monday to Friday (excluding statutory holidays) during this limited period. 

The installation of three tower cranes should begin in January of next year. The first crane will be close to the southwest corner, the second one near the northwest corner and the third one further to the east near the middle of the site.  

Excavation and drilling for the foundations to support the future overbuild park above the rail corridor should begin at the end of November and continue until the middle of February of next year. This work will occur outside of the normal train operating hours, and in coordination with work done by others in the rail corridor. 

A community information website on the CIBC Square project will be available to you soon. You will be able to refer to this site for future construction and project updates. We will notify you when the site is online.

We appreciate your interest in the CIBC Square project and look forward to participating in the development of the SouthCore community.
